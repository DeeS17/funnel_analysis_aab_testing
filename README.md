# funnel_analysis_aab_testing

In my project, I will perform an event-driven funnel analysis on an app selling food products.

In the next stage, I did an A/A/B testing analysis, because the web designer team changed the fonts for the entire application. The Product Manager was worried that users would find the new design disturbing. So they decided to make a decision based on the results of A/A/B testing.
